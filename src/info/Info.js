I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

    bio: ["Greetings to all", "My name's Camilo Hurtado. I am a Full Stack Developer with an academic background in Engineering.", "Throughout my university and my years working as a mechanical engineering I felt a strong attraction towards programming, the projects that I enjoyed the most were those that included any programming related tasks." ,"For this reason, after some years working as an engineer I decided to change my career path and focus on what I feel is my true passion, programming and the world of IT. Thanks to Henry I now have all the necessary tools to be able to function in the world of programming, such as Node.js, React, Redux, SQL among other technologies.","I strongly believe that my training in engineering gave me the tools to become an integrated human being, I am very professional , love working with people and can connect easily with others, all this along with the fact that I am a natural problem solver with a calm and collected state of mind."],
